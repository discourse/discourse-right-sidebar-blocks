# Right Sidebar Blocks

Adds ability to display a right-sided sidebar to topic list routes. There are two settings included:

- `blocks`: choose the blocks to display and adjust their ordering
- `show_in_routes`: decide which routes to display the sidebar (by default, it will show on all lists except for `/categories`)

### Included blocks

This theme component includes a few blocks you can use in your sidebar:

- popular-tags
- top-contributors
- recent-replies
- category-topics
- custom-html
- subcategory-list
- tag-topics
- top-topics
- category-list

You can also use other Ember components as blocks, you just need to use the correct name. For example, core includes a `signup-cta` Ember component, and you can use it in the sidebar as is. (Note that you can't use components that expect a set of parameters.)

### Available block parameters

You can control some features for the provided blocks via parameters.
